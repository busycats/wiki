# Viagra

Viagra is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. It contains the active ingredient sildenafil citrate, which belongs to a class of drugs known as phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Viagra helps increase blood flow to the penis, enabling a man to achieve and maintain an erection when sexually aroused.

## How Viagra Works

When a man is sexually stimulated, the arteries in the penis relax and widen, allowing more blood to flow into the erectile tissues. At the same time, the veins that carry blood away from the penis constrict, trapping the blood in the erectile tissues, which causes an erection.

In men with erectile dysfunction, the enzyme PDE5 breaks down a chemical called cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which is responsible for the relaxation of the arteries and the smooth muscle in the penis. By inhibiting the action of PDE5, Viagra helps to maintain higher levels of cGMP, leading to improved blood flow and better erectile function.

It is important to note that Viagra does not automatically cause an erection. Sexual stimulation is still required to initiate the release of nitric oxide, a chemical that activates the production of cGMP. Viagra simply enhances the natural erectile response when sexual stimulation occurs.

## Usage and Dosage

Viagra is available in tablet form and is typically taken orally, swallowed with water. The recommended dosage of Viagra varies depending on the individual and the severity of their erectile dysfunction. It is important to follow the instructions provided by the prescribing healthcare professional or the information on the medication label.

Generally, Viagra is taken approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour before sexual activity. It should not be taken more than once a day. The effects of Viagra can last for up to 4-5 hours, allowing for spontaneity in sexual encounters within that timeframe.

Precautions and Side Effects
Before taking Viagra, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications. Precautions and potential side effects associated with Viagra include:

Allergies: Viagra should not be taken by individuals who are allergic to sildenafil or any of the other ingredients in the medication.
Medical Conditions: It is crucial to disclose any existing medical conditions, such as heart problems, high or low blood pressure, liver or kidney disease, and eye problems, to your healthcare professional.
Medication Interactions: Certain medications, especially those containing nitrates, can interact with Viagra and cause a significant drop in blood pressure. Inform your healthcare professional about all the medications you are currently taking.
Common Side Effects: Some common side effects of Viagra may include headaches, dizziness, flushing, indigestion, nasal congestion, and changes in vision. These side effects are typically mild and temporary.
If you experience severe or persistent side effects or have an erection lasting longer than 4 hours (priapism), seek immediate medical attention.

Generic versions have been available since 2013, and Teva began providing the generic drug in December 2017 after a legal agreement with Pfizer.
